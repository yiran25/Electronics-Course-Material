1. Microcontroller has more tha microprocessor, almost like a computer 

2. How to program a microcontroller: Write to general purpose registers 

3. Ardruino  

	- Arduino IDE & libraries can be used in different microcontroller platforms  

	- Teensy (ARM), Arduino (Atmel), STM32 (ARM), ESP32 (RISC) 

	- ESP32: 

		Two cores for parallel processing 

		18 ADCs 

		3 SPIs: communicate with sensors 

		15 PWM output 

		2 DAC 

		2 I2S: sensing (detect lick) 

		Wifi & bluetooth  

4. Installation 

	- Preference --> add the board url --> tool --> board manager --> find your board --> install 

	- Install library: sketch --> include library --> search for library --> install 

	- Open arduino from terminal: open /Applications/Arduino 2.app 

5. Arduino script: 

	#include libraries 

	Declare objects 
	
	Declare global variables 

	setup() function 

	loop() function 
6. Example: Control LED via bluetooth from Chrome: https://github.com/jasoncoon/esp32-fastled-ble
